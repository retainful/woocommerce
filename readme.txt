Recover abandoned carts in WooCommerce with a single click using Retainful. Drive repeat purchases by sending Next Order Coupons and increase the revenue.

== Description ==

[Retainful](https://wwww.retainful.com?utm_source=wp_directory&utm_medium=description&utm_campaign=marketplace&utm_content=visit_site) helps you recover WooCommerce abandoned carts with a single click. It can automatically send a series of email reminders when customers abandon their carts in your shop.

== Abandoned Cart Recovery in WooCommerce ==

7 out of 10 potential shoppers leave your store without buying. But you can reduce the cart abandonment rate and recover the lost sales by sending a well timed, sequence of email reminders.
It is a proven fact that abandoned cart recovery emails can recover at least 30% of the lost sales.

Retainful automates your abandoned cart recovery. You can schedule a series of timed email reminders that can be sent to the customers to recover your WooCommerce abandoned carts.

**Here is an example:**

* Send the first email remainder 30 minutes after the customer abandoned the cart
* Trigger another email reminder after 6 hours of abandonment automatically.
* Remind the customer again a day after. This time, include a coupon code in the email.
* Not recovered in 3 days? Send another abandoned cart reminder 3 days after

All these abandoned cart email reminders can be scheduled and automatically sent. No need to manually send these emails.
Retainful can automatically send these abandoned cart reminders in the background.

== Next Order Coupons ==

In addition to abandoned cart recovery emails, Retainful also helps you drive repeat purchases by sending single-use, unique coupon codes for the next purchase.
The customer can redeem this coupon code during their next purchase. This helps you retain your existing customers, get repeated orders and earn more dollars per customer.

=== Next Order Coupon features: ===

**Supercharge your transactional emails**

Retainful comes with an awesome coupon box layout that gets automatically included in the order notifications. You can choose which order statuses should include the Next Order Coupon box.

**Coupon Expiry/Validity**
You can set an expiry / validity for the next order coupon. Example: You can set the coupon to expire after 10 days.
This will motivate the customer to make his next purchase within 10 days.

**Usage restrictions**
Limit the coupon to be used only for certain categories or products. You can exclude the products and categories from the coupon as well.

**Minimum/Maximum Spend**
You can choose to apply the coupon only when a customer spends a minimum value for his next purchase.

**Exclude Products on Sale**
If you already have products on Sale, you can choose to exclude them from getting a discount from the next order coupon.

**Reduces the friction / Auto Apply Coupon**

Customer does not have to copy and paste (or type out) the coupon code. They can simply click the Go button/link and the code gets automatically applied at cart when they add any products.
So there is less friction which increases the conversions.

**Seamless integration with WooCommerce**

Whether you are using the default transactional emails of WooCommerce or use an email customizer, Retainful plays nice with them and includes the single-use coupon.

**Insights and Analytics**

The Retainful Dashboard shows you the conversions in real-time and know how much money you made through repeat purchases using Retainful coupons. See who have opened the cart recovery emails and the total revenue recovered from lost your carts.


== Retainful Premium ==

[Upgrade to Premium](https://app.retainful.com?utm_source=wp_directory&utm_medium=description&utm_campaign=marketplace&utm_content=upgrade) and get more awesome features to recover your abandoned carts.

Retainful comes with **three premium add-ons** and **premium email templates** to recover the sales effectively.

=== Premium Features (Add-ons): ===

**Email Collection Popup**

[Collect the email address] (https://www.retainful.com/docs/woocommerce/collect-email-address-before-adding-to-cart-in-woocommerce?utm_source=wp_directory&utm_medium=description&utm_campaign=marketplace&utm_content=doc_link) before the customer adds an item to cart.
Trigger a popup when the customer clicks add to cart and get their email address. The popup is fully customisable. Change the colour, background, text and the labels.
This enables you to follow-up the customer even if he abandons the cart.
If an existing customer logs in, automatically associate their cart with their email.

**Countdown Timer with Automatic Coupon Application**

Add an urgency to complete the checkout by showing a [countdown timer with an offer](https://www.retainful.com/docs/woocommerce/coupon-timer?utm_source=wp_directory&utm_medium=description&utm_campaign=marketplace&utm_content=doc_link). Let it apply a coupon automatically and set a countdown timer for the coupon.
The feature implements the two proven psychological motivators - Urgency and FOMO (Fear of Missing Out). Once the timer ends, the coupon is removed. So the customer will purchase because he does not want to miss the offer.

**Coupon for Email Collection**

Not every visitor will be ready to input their email address at the time of adding an item to cart. Instead of plainly asking for the email, you can say "get a 10% discount code in your email. Please enter your email".
This will encourage the customer to enter their email ID to get the coupon code. Retainful allows you to collect the Email ID and send an email with the coupon code.
