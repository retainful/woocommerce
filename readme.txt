== Abandoned Cart Recovery in WooCommerce ==

Research shows that about 70 to 80% of customers abandon their carts and leave your store without buying. At least 40 to 60% of these abandoned carts can be recovered by sending well-timed, series of email reminders. 

Retainful helps you **automatically send recovery emails** when customers abandon their carts. You can schedule a series of well-timed email reminders that can be sent to the customers to recover their carts and complete the purchase.

**Here is an example:**

* **First email** is sent **30 minutes after** the customer abandoned the cart
* **Second email** is sent **6 hours after** the abandonment automatically.
* **Third email** can be sent **a day after**. This time, include a coupon code in the email. Each customer can be sent a unique, single-use coupon code.
* **Fourth** abandoned cart reminder goes **3 days after** (if the cart still remains un-recovered)

All these abandoned cart email reminders can be scheduled and sent automatically. No need to manually send these emails.

Retainful can automatically send these abandoned cart reminders and it stops the moment customer completes the purchase. [A step-by-step guide to create your abandoned cart recovery email campaign](https://help.retainful.com/automations/abandoned-cart-recovery-email-campaign)

**How does Abandoned Cart Recovery work?**

- The plugin captures the email address as soon as customer enters it at the checkout step. (Guest checkout is supported. Customer does not have to login)
- If the customer did not complete the purchase, Retainful automatically sends the first email reminder with a unique recovery link
- Customer clicks the link to recover his cart. 
- Completes the purchase

**Exit-Intent Popup**

[Convert your visitors into customers](https://help.retainful.com/tools/exit-intent-popup?utm_source=wp_directory&utm_medium=description&utm_campaign=marketplace&utm_content=doc_link) when they try to leave your shop with items in their cart. Track the mouse behaviour of your customers and trigger a popup with coupon or collect email when the customer tries to exit.
With the exit popups, you can encourage the visitors to complete their purchase ot leave their email.

**Add-to-cart Email Capture Popup**

[Collect the email address](https://help.retainful.com/tools/add-to-cart-email-capture-popup?utm_source=wp_directory&utm_medium=description&utm_campaign=marketplace&utm_content=doc_link) before the customer adds an item to cart.
Trigger a popup when the customer clicks add to cart and get their email address. The popup is fully customisable. Change the colour, background, text and the labels.
This enables you to follow-up the customer even if he abandons the cart.
If an existing customer logs in, automatically associate their cart with their email.

**Countdown Timer with Automatic Coupon Application**

Add an urgency to complete the checkout by showing a [countdown timer with an offer](https://help.retainful.com/tools/coupon-timer?utm_source=wp_directory&utm_medium=description&utm_campaign=marketplace&utm_content=doc_link).

**Coupon for Email Collection**

Not every visitor will be ready to input their email address at the time of adding an item to cart. Instead of plainly asking for the email, you can say "get a 10% discount code in your email. Please enter your email".
This will encourage the customer to enter their email ID to get the coupon code. Retainful allows you to collect the Email ID and send an email with the coupon code.
