Stop cart abandonment in WooCommerce and recover lost revenue with Retainful. Drive repeat purchases by sending Next Order Coupons and increase the sales.

== Description ==

[Retainful](https://www.retainful.com?utm_source=wp_directory&utm_medium=description&utm_campaign=marketplace&utm_content=visit_site) helps you recover abandoned carts and drive repeat purchases in your WooCommerce store. It can capture the email address and automatically send a series of email reminders when customers abandon their carts in your shop.

== Abandoned Cart Recovery in WooCommerce ==

Research shows that about 70 to 80% of customers abandon their carts and leave your store without buying. At least 40 to 60% of these abandoned carts can be recovered by sending well-timed, series of email reminders. 

Retainful helps you **automatically send recovery emails** when customers abandon their carts. You can schedule a series of timed email reminders that can be sent to the customers to recover their carts and complete the purchase.

**Here is an example:**

* **First email** is sent **30 minutes after** the customer abandoned the cart
* **Second email** is sent **6 hours after** the abandonment automatically.
* **Third email** can be sent **a day after**. This time, include a coupon code in the email.
* **Fourth** abandoned cart reminder goes **3 days after** (if the cart still remains un-recovered)

All these abandoned cart email reminders can be scheduled and sent automatically. No need to manually send these emails.

Retainful can automatically send these abandoned cart reminders and it stops the moment customer completes the purchase.

**How does Retainful work?**

- The plugin captures the email address as soon as customer enters it at the checkout step. 
- If the customer has not completed the purchase within 30 minutes, ifirst email reminder is sent automatically with a unique recovery link
- Customer clicks the link to recover his cart. 
- Completes the purchase

With Retainful Premium plans, you can also [capture customer's email when they add an item to cart](https://www.retainful.com/docs/woocommerce/collect-email-address-before-adding-to-cart-in-woocommerce?utm_source=wp_directory&utm_medium=description&utm_campaign=marketplace&utm_content=doc_link) or when they try to leave your site without buying, i.e, [Exit Intent Popup](https://www.retainful.com/docs/woocommerce/exit-intent-popup?utm_source=wp_directory&utm_medium=description&utm_campaign=marketplace&utm_content=doc_link) 

**How to get started with Retainful?**

1. Install and activate the plugin
2. [Sign up for a free account](https://app.retainful.com?utm_source=wp_directory&utm_medium=description&utm_campaign=marketplace&utm_content=signup) and get your API Keys
3. Connect to Retainful

Retainful can do more than recovering your lost sales. It can drive repeat purchases in your store. Say hello to [Next Order Coupons for WooCommerce](https://www.retainful.com/blog/how-to-provide-next-order-coupon-in-woocommerce?utm_source=wp_directory&utm_medium=description&utm_campaign=marketplace&utm_content=next-order-coupon)

== Next Order Coupons ==

Retainful can help you drive repeat purchases by sending single-use, unique coupon codes for the next purchase.

The customer can redeem this coupon code during their next purchase. This helps you retain your existing customers, get repeated orders and earn more dollars per customer.

== Customize emails with Drag and Drop Visual Email Editor ==

Create beautiful, mobile-friendly emails in minutes using the Retainful's powerful drag and drop email editor. Use our ready-to-use email templates and customize them in minutes to reflect your brand. Add a logo, custom text, images, social icons and links, shop address, coupon and more using the drag and drop editor.

== Better Performance and Site Speed ==

With Retainful 2.0, you can now track and recover abandoned carts without adding any additional load to your site performance. When storing tons of abandoned carts and running constant cron jobs in your site for scheduling and sending emails, it consumes quite a lot of your server resources, affecting the site performance. (For example, you have set an email to be sent 15 minutes after a cart is abandoned. That means, a cron job should be running repeatedly at least every 5 minutes and the site had to constantly run checks after checks whether the time has come to send the email. If not, the email won't go at the right time. These constant checks will have a huge impact on the site).

Instead, you can let Retainful handle abandoned cart recovery campaigns for you. This will ensure that you can track any number of abandoned carts, run the recovery campaigns and monitor the revenue generated from your campaigns, without adding any additional loads to your site.

=== Next Order Coupon features: ===

**Supercharge your transactional emails**

Retainful comes with an awesome coupon box layout that gets automatically included in the order notifications. You can choose which order statuses should include the Next Order Coupon box.

**Coupon Expiry/Validity**
You can set an expiry / validity for the next order coupon. Example: You can set the coupon to expire after 10 days.
This will motivate the customer to make his next purchase within 10 days.

**Usage restrictions**
Limit the coupon to be used only for certain categories or products. You can exclude the products and categories from the coupon as well.

**Minimum/Maximum Spend**
You can choose to apply the coupon only when a customer spends a minimum value for his next purchase.

**Exclude Products on Sale**
If you already have products on Sale, you can choose to exclude them from getting a discount from the next order coupon.

**Reduces the friction / Auto Apply Coupon**

Customer does not have to copy and paste (or type out) the coupon code. They can simply click the Go button/link and the code gets automatically applied at cart when they add any products.
So there is less friction which increases the conversions.

**Seamless integration with WooCommerce**

Whether you are using the default transactional emails of WooCommerce or use an email customizer, Retainful plays nice with them and includes the single-use coupon.

**Insights and Analytics**

The Retainful Dashboard shows you the conversions in real-time and know how much money you made through repeat purchases using Retainful coupons. See who have opened the cart recovery emails and the total revenue recovered from lost your carts.


== Retainful Premium Add-ons ==

Retainful comes with **premium add-ons** to recover the sales effectively.

=== Premium Add-ons: ===

**Exit-Intent Popup**

[Convert your visitors into customers](https://www.retainful.com/docs/woocommerce/exit-intent-popup?utm_source=wp_directory&utm_medium=description&utm_campaign=marketplace&utm_content=doc_link) when they try to leave your shop with items in their cart. Track the mouse behaviour of your customers and trigger a popup with coupon or collect email when the customer tries to exit.
With the exit popups, you can encourage the visitors to complete their purchase ot leave their email.

**Add-to-cart Email Capture Popup**

[Collect the email address](https://www.retainful.com/docs/woocommerce/collect-email-address-before-adding-to-cart-in-woocommerce?utm_source=wp_directory&utm_medium=description&utm_campaign=marketplace&utm_content=doc_link) before the customer adds an item to cart.
Trigger a popup when the customer clicks add to cart and get their email address. The popup is fully customisable. Change the colour, background, text and the labels.
This enables you to follow-up the customer even if he abandons the cart.
If an existing customer logs in, automatically associate their cart with their email.

**Countdown Timer with Automatic Coupon Application**

Add an urgency to complete the checkout by showing a [countdown timer with an offer](https://www.retainful.com/docs/woocommerce/coupon-timer?utm_source=wp_directory&utm_medium=description&utm_campaign=marketplace&utm_content=doc_link). Let it apply a coupon automatically and set a countdown timer for the coupon.
The feature implements the two proven psychological motivators - Urgency and FOMO (Fear of Missing Out). Once the timer ends, the coupon is removed. So the customer will purchase because he does not want to miss the offer.

**Coupon for Email Collection**

Not every visitor will be ready to input their email address at the time of adding an item to cart. Instead of plainly asking for the email, you can say "get a 10% discount code in your email. Please enter your email".
This will encourage the customer to enter their email ID to get the coupon code. Retainful allows you to collect the Email ID and send an email with the coupon code.
