Drive repeat purchases and get more dollars per customer in your WooCommerce store by automatically sending single-use coupons for next purchase.

== Description ==

Your customers don’t just buy one product or use your service once. They come back again and again for more. So why not provide them a little motivation in the form of a coupon? It will help you retain your customer, increase your customers’ lifetime value and boost the revenue.

Retainful provides a simple, easiest way to retain your customers and encourages them to purchase repeatedly from your WooCommerce online store. It automatically sends a single-use, unique coupon code when your customer purchases at your online store.

==Why you should use Retainful?==

It’s easier and less expensive to retain customers than to acquire them. That's why most ecommerce businesses including Amazon focus on their existing customer base.
Your probability of selling to an existing customer is at least 40 percent more likely than converting someone who has never bought from you before. Existing customers also spend 31 percent more than new leads, and when you release a new product, your loyal customers are 50 percent more likely to give it a shot.

You’ll spend five times less money on customer retention.

==What Retainful can do for your WooCommerce Store?==

Unlike other coupon plugins, Retainful generates a unique, single use coupon code and includes them within the default WooCommerce order notification email itself.
This catches the attention of the customer and motivates him to come back and use the coupon for his next purchase.
What's more? You can add an urgency for the next purchase by setting a validity for the coupon. Example: Coupon expires after 10 days from the date of purchase.

The order notification, transaction emails have a very higher opening rate rather than the plain promotional emails. Also 99.99% of the transactional emails land in the inbox, while the
promotional emails gets into the Promotions tab or in Junk. So Retainful helps you increase the conversions tremendously and grow your business.

==Why you should retain your customers?==

Studies proved that you only have a 5-20% chance of selling to a new prospect. For your existing customers, you have a 60-70% chance of a successful sale!

* It also helps you build amazing relationships with your customers.
