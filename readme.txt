More than 69% of shoppers abandon their cart and leave your site without purchasing. Retainful helps you recover abandoned carts in your WooCommerce store easily and increase the revenue.

== Description ==

The fact that you are losing 7 out of 10 potential customers is quite serious. Shopping cart abandonment is an acute problem faced by almost all eCommerce stores in the World.
But research shows that at least 40 to 50% of these abandoned carts are recoverable.

The best abandoned cart recovery solution is - Email Remainders. It is a proven fact that abandoned cart recovery emails can recover at least 30% of the lost carts.

Retainful helps automate your abandoned cart emails. You can schedule a series of timed email reminders that can be sent to the customers to recover your WooCommerce abandoned carts.

**Here is an example**

* Send the first email remainder 30 minutes after the customer abandoned the cart
* Trigger another email reminder after 6 hours of abandonment automatically.
* Remind the customer again a day after. This time, include a coupon code in the email.
* Not recovered in 3 days? Send another abandoned cart reminder 3 days after

All these abandoned cart email reminders can be scheduled and automatically sent. No need to manually send these emails.
Retainful can automatically send these abandoned cart reminders in the background.


== What more Retainful can do for your WooCommerce Store? ==

Retainful also provides a simple, easiest way to retain your customers and encourages them to purchase repeatedly from your WooCommerce online store. It can automatically send a single-use, unique coupon code when your customer purchases at your online store.
Your customers don’t just buy one product or use your service once. They come back again and again for more. So why not provide them a little motivation in the form of a coupon? It will help you retain your customer, increase your customers’ lifetime value and boost the revenue.

Unlike other coupon plugins, Retainful generates a unique, single use coupon code and includes them within the default WooCommerce order notification email itself.
This catches the attention of the customer and motivates him to come back and use the coupon for his next purchase.
What's more? You can add an urgency for the next purchase by setting a validity for the coupon. Example: Coupon expires after 10 days from the date of purchase.

The order notification, transaction emails have a very higher opening rate rather than the plain promotional emails. Also 99.99% of the transactional emails land in the inbox, while the
promotional emails gets into the Promotions tab or in Junk. So Retainful helps you increase the conversions tremendously and grow your business.

Retainful comes with an awesome coupon box layout that gets automatically included in the order notifications. You can choose which order statuses should include the Next Order Coupon box.

**Coupon Expiry/Validity**
You can set an expiry / validity for the next order coupon. Example: You can set the coupon to expire after 10 days.
This will motivate the customer to make his next purchase within 10 days.

**Usage restrictions**
Limit the coupon to be used only for certain categories or products. You can exclude the products and categories from the coupon as well.

**Minimum/Maximum Spend**
You can choose to apply the coupon only when a customer spends a minimum value for his next purchase.

**Exclude Products on Sale**

Customer does not have to copy and paste (or type out) the coupon code. They can simply click the Go button/link and the code gets automatically applied at cart when they add any products.
